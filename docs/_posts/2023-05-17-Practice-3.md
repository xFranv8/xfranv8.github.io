In this practice we were supposed to implement an autolocalization algorithm based on the Perspective N Points (PnP) algorithm. 
The algorithm is based on the following steps:
1. First, we need to calibrate our camera.

For this purpose, we will use the algorithm that we have already used in another subject of the master (3D Vision). This algorithm requieres a series of images from
a chessboard taken from different angles.

In this case, we've used 12 images taken with my phone camera.

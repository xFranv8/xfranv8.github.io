This week I've managed to develop a controller for my vehicle in the CARLA simulation. The proccess followed to develop this system is as follows:

First, we have to detect edges in our image. This is very easy as we have an OpenCV method that implements the Canny Edge Detector, which is very useful for the task at hand.

After that, I performed some morphological operations on the image returned by the border detector. Specifically, I performed 3 dilatations and 3 erosions with a 5x5 kernel.

Finally, the idea is to detect the coordinates of the lane markings, so I used the HoughTransform, which calculates lines on an image.

The result was not pretty good. As you can see in the first image, my algorithm only detects one line.

</figure>

The other problem of using this method was that it was computationally too expensive, so when we finally get the result from the transform, the car had already moved and the calculations for the throttle and the steer were useless.

Finally, I realised that there was a much simple way of getting the coordinates of the lane markings. Just moving horizontally along the image and counting how many pixels there were from the x position of the car to the first non-black pixel to the left and to the right in the resulting image of the morphological operations, we can determine the (x, y) coordinates we need. 


With these two points(right lane marking coordinates and left lane marking coordinates) we calculate the midpoint and measure the distance from this midpoint to the position where the car is located, resulting in the steer we have to apply to the vehicle.

The last step is to decide what percentage of the calculated steering angle we are going to apply, I have solved this problem by trial and error.


This is the result:

I also had to deal with the broken lines of the lane markings to keep the vehicle inside the right lane.


This week I've also dedicated some time to read some mores master's thesis related to autonomous UAVs and deep learning, so I now have a better idea of what I am going to do in my master's thesis, which will probably be something related to autonomous driving and reinforcement learning in CARLA simulator
